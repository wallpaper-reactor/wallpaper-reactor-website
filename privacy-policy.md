# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** June 28, 2025

### 1. Information Collection and Use
We do **not** collect any personal information (such as names, email addresses, or account details) from users of Wallpaper Reactor.

### 2. Analytics & Crash Reporting
We use third-party analytics and crash-reporting services to help improve app performance and stability. These services automatically collect anonymized device and usage information (e.g., device model, OS version, session duration, error logs).

### 3. User-Submitted Content
At this time, Wallpaper Reactor does not allow users to upload or sync their own wallpapers, so we do not collect any related metadata.

### 4. Cookies & Local Storage
We store certain settings and preferences locally on your device (via local storage) so that your experience remains smooth and personalized each time you launch the app. You can clear this data by uninstalling the app or clearing its storage from your device settings.

### 5. Third-Party Services
We display ads through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect limited data in accordance with its own privacy policy: [AdMob Privacy & Security](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543).

### 6. Data Sharing & Retention
We do not share any personal data with third parties. Analytics and crash data are retained by the service providers according to their policies. Local storage data remains on your device until you choose to clear or remove it.

### 7. User Rights & Controls
There are currently no in-app settings to opt out of analytics or delete stored data. To remove all data, you may uninstall the app or clear its storage via your device’s settings. For ad personalization controls, please adjust your device’s ad settings.

### 8. Children’s Privacy
Wallpaper Reactor is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

### 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with a revised **Last updated** date. Please review it periodically.
