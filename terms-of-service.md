# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** August 8, 2025

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Wallpaper Reactor mobile and desktop applications and any related services (collectively, the “**Service**”) provided by Kyle Eichlin (“**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”). By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

---

## 1. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.

---

## 2. Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms within the app or on our website and update the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

---

## 3. Description of the Service
Wallpaper Reactor lets you browse, set, and share live wallpapers—videos, animations, web‑based shaders, and more—across your devices. Users may create optional accounts to upload custom content, sync preferences, and access additional features. The basic Service is free and supported by in‑app advertisements; optional paid subscriptions remove ads and unlock premium features.

---

## 4. Accounts & User Conduct
- **Accounts (Optional).** You may use basic features anonymously; creating an account is not required. Accounts are created through OAuth authentication with Google, Apple, or Discord.
- **Account Security.** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and the activities that occur under it.
- **Account Termination.** You may request account deletion at any time by contacting us. Wallpapers you've uploaded will remain available unless deleted individually.
- **Prohibited Conduct.** You agree not to:
  - Copy or extract any proprietary assets (e.g., wallpapers, code, data) except as expressly permitted;
  - Upload or distribute malware, infringing content, or material that violates any third‑party rights;
  - Interfere with the Service's operation or security;
  - Create fake accounts or impersonate others;
  - Upload content that is illegal, harmful, or violates community standards.

---

## 5. User‑Generated Content & License
- **Uploads.** Account holders may upload wallpapers or other content ("**User Content**").
- **Your Rights.** You retain ownership of your User Content and represent that you have the right to upload it.
- **License to Us.** By uploading User Content, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free, transferable, sublicensable right to use, reproduce, display, distribute, and adapt that content within Wallpaper Reactor and in marketing or future features.
- **Content Standards.** User Content must not violate these Terms, applicable laws, or third-party rights. We reserve the right to remove content that violates these standards.
- **Removal.** You may delete your User Content at any time through the app interface. We will remove it from public view within a reasonable time but may retain archived copies for fraud prevention and record‑keeping.

---

## 6. Paid Subscriptions & Ads
- **Free Tier.** Includes ads.
- **Subscriptions.** Available in‑app; your subscription automatically renews unless canceled before the end of the current period. All billing is handled through the platform (e.g., Google Play, App Store), and you must abide by their terms.
- **Cancellation & Refunds.** You manage cancellations via your platform’s subscription settings. We do not provide refunds, except as required by law.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property
- **Our Rights.** All rights, title, and interest in the Service—excluding your User Content—are owned by us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our express permission.
- **Third‑Party Materials.** The Service may include content licensed from third parties. Their use remains subject to those licensors’ terms.

---

## 8. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties. You may also stop using the Service at any time.

---

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR‑FREE, OR SECURE.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS (USD 50).

---

## 11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of New York, USA, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. Any dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York.

---

## 12. Miscellaneous
- **Entire Agreement.** These Terms, together with any in‑app or online policies we link to, constitute the entire agreement regarding the Service.
- **Severability.** If any provision is held unenforceable, the rest remain in full force.
- **Waiver.** Our failure to enforce any right under these Terms is not a waiver of that right.
