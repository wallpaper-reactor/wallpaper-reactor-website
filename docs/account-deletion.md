# Account Deletion

## How to Request Account Deletion

To request deletion of your **Wallpaper Reactor** account, please follow these steps:

1. Email kyle@ark.place from the email address associated with your account
2. Include "Account Deletion Request" in the subject line
3. Request deletion of your account in the email body

Your account deletion will be completed within a few days of receiving your request.

## What Data is Deleted vs. Kept

**Data that will be deleted:**
- Your user account information (profile, email, settings)
- Personal data associated with your account
- Private wallpapers and favorites

**Data that will be kept:**
- Any public wallpapers you have uploaded will remain available in the gallery
- Non-deleted wallpapers will continue to be accessible to other users

There is no additional retention period - once your account is deleted, your personal account data is permanently removed from our systems.
